# A Computer Vision Model to Detect People Wearing Face Masks

🌟 Hosted @ https://g-andrey.github.io/Face-mask-detection/#/ 🌟

## Goal :dart:
1. Train a robust yet lightweight computer vision model that can detect whether or not a person is wearing a face using bounding box annotations.
2. Deploy the model via a webapp where users can test the model with their own webcam and with uploaded images.
